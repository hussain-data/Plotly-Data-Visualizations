This repository contains a data analysis project exploring the **US Honey Production dataset** from 1998 to 2021. The primary focus is on creating dynamic and interactive visualizations using the Plotly library in Python to uncover trends and insights.

## üìä Visualizations Included

This project explores the dataset through a variety of interactive plots, allowing users to hover, zoom, and filter the data to gain deeper insights. Key visualizations in the `Interactive_plotly.ipynb` notebook include:

* **Histograms:** To understand the distribution of variables like `average_price` and `production`.
* **Bar Charts:** For comparing yearly averages and totals.
* **Scatter Plots:** To explore the relationship between honey production and stock levels.
* **Choropleth Maps:** To visualize honey production and yield per colony on a state-by-state basis.
* **Sunburst Plots:** To show the hierarchical relationship between years, yield categories, and states.

## üíæ Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the **"US Honey Production"** dataset, which contains information on honey production, stocks, price, and yield per colony for various states in the United States from 1998 to 2021.

* **Source:** The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/honey-production).
* **Columns include:** `state`, `numcol` (number of colonies), `yieldpercol` (yield per colony), `totalprod` (total production), `stocks`, `priceperlb` (price per pound), and `year`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries Used

This project is built using Python and several key data science libraries:

* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and cleaning.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Plotly Express:** For creating high-level interactive visualizations.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** As the development environment.
